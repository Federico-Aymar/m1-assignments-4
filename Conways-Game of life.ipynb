    "# Conway's Game of Life\n",
    "Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automata simulation that follows simple rules to create visual patterns.\n",
    "The *game* is played on a two-dimensional board (a grid) of cells. Each cell can be either black or white.\n",
    "The board evolves according to the following rules:\n",
    "- Living (black) cells with two or three neighbors stay alive in the next step of the simulation;\n",
    "- Dead (white) cells with exactly three living neighbors become alive in the next step of the simulation;\n",
    "- Any other cell dies or stays dead in the next step of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The living or dead state of the cells in the next step of the simulation depends entirely on their current state. There is no *memory* whatsoever for the grid cells beside the current board status, which rules the living or dead state of the cells in the next step of the simulation."

    "Before starting to code your solution, let's highlight a few aspects you may want to brainstorm in advance:\n",
    "- Which format is most suitable representation for our data?\n",
    "- How do we populate the grid in the beginning?\n",
    "- Which parts of the code could be factored out in separate functions?\n",
    "- How could we handle the main game-loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most suitable format to represent this problem is that of matrix of the size of the two-dimensional board, which are entered by the users when the program is launched. Within it, it must be filled with two random numbers, 0 or 1, which respectively represent the vital status of a cell. To avoid infinite iterations a while-loop has been chosen, in order to stop cell evolution in case there are no more living cells, if the cells keeps the same configuration for two consecutive steps and the number of steps is higher than a fixed number. For this purpose, two functions are created. The first one is called **grid_formation**, which receives as input the size of grid and of cell, set as three in order to reduce nuber of steps. Checked that information given in input are numerical and that both the number of rows and columns is higher than cell size, two parameters are randomly set to place the cell inside the grid and a the grid is created. To create the cell, a 3x3 section of the grid is selected and randomly composed of 0, which stands for dead cells, and 1, which stands for living cells. To these values, it is associated a color with which displays data as image, coloring white cells which contains 0 and coloring black cells which contains 1. The function returns the grid, which will be used as input parameter for the second function. "
